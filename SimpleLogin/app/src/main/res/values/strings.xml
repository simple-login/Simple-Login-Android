    <string name="app_short_description">SimpleLogin is a open source solution to protect your online identity.\n\nSimpleLogin strives to offer a simple experience for both users and partners/developers</string>
    <string name="step_1">The next time a website asks for your email address, just create a new alias instead of using your real email.</string>
    <string name="step_2">All emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your \"real\" email address without the sender knowing anything.</string>
    <string name="step_3">On your desktop, you can install our browser extension to manage and quickly create aliases on the fly.\n\nOn your smartphone with SimpleLogin installed, whenever you need to register to a website, simply \"share\" the website you are visiting with SimpleLogin to quickly create an alias.</string>
    <string name="what_a">Subscribe to mailing lists, create new online accounts with email alias.\n\nAll emails sent to an alias will be forwarded to your personal inbox.\n\nLater on, simply block an alias if it\'s too spammy.</string>
    <string name="what_b">Just hit \"Reply\" whenever you need to reply to a forwarded email: the reply will come from the alias and your personal mailbox stays hidden.\n\nYou can also send emails to any email address from your alias.</string>
    <string name="what_c">Use alias as your business email.\n\nSave $6/month for each business email created with SimpleLogin.\n\nBy the way our company emails are actually aliases.</string>
    <string name="faq_0">Email alias is similar to forward email address: all emails sent to an alias will be forwarded to your inbox.\n\nThanks to SimpleLogin technology, an alias can also send emails.\n\nFor your contact, the alias is therefore your email address.</string>
    <string name="faq_1">Yes! An email alias is actually a normal email address that exists forever unless you remove it on your SimpleLogin dashboard.</string>
    <string name="faq_2">SimpleLogin alias are permanent as opposed to the temporary emails created on services like temp-mail.org, 10minutesmail.net, etc.\n\nSimpleLogin also doesn\'t store the emails.\n\nWe are simply different products for different usecases.</string>
    <string name="faq_3">SimpleLogin doesn\'t store the emails (we don\'t want to become another Gmail 💰).\n\nTechnically the emails DO arrive at SimpleLogin server and we modify email headers to implement the \"magic\" but the email content is never read.</string>
    <string name="forgot_password_message">For security reason and to avoid database leak, all \"forgot password\" requests are taken into account silently without you being informed if a request is successful or not.\n\nSo make sure that you enter the correct email address.</string>
    <string name="create_alias_hint">💡Hint: To make it easy to remember for later use, it is a good practice to use the name of the website/service that you plan to register with alias.</string>
    <string name="create_alias_warning">⚠️ Only letters, numbers, dash (-) &amp; underscore (_) are allowed.</string>
    <string name="api_key_explanation">To get your API key, you must sign in SimpleLogin by using a browser, then navigate to \"API Key\" tab, create one if not already then copy and paste the key here.</string>
